# TLBO_CTRW_TPL
TLBO_CTRW_TPL.m is the computer code of TLBO algorithm to estimate the CTRW-TPL parameters. 
The CTRW_TPL_fit.m calculates the objective function to optimize the CTRW-TPL parameters. 
The CTRW_TPL_fit.m uses the analytical solution of the CTRW-TPL. 
TLBO_CTRW_TPL.m is linked to  CTRW_TPL_fit.
Note that TLBO_CTRW_TPL.m and CTRW_TPL_fit.m must be in the same folder. 
To run the TLBO_CTRW_TPL.m, open it and click on the run buttom.  
The Validation.m calculates the breakthrough curves using the estimated CTRW_TPL parameters.  
The Criteria_Calculation.m calculates the statistical criteria to compare the DIM and CTRWMT, descriped in the manuscript. 
Note that the all scripts were designed in MATLAB 2017a.
